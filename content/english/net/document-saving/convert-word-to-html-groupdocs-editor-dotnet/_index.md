## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the process of extracting HTML content from Word documents using GroupDocs.Editor into manageable steps.

### Load the Word Document

**Overview:** Start by loading your Word document into a FileStream, which will be used to create an Editor instance.
```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docx");
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(inputFilePath))
{
    // Initialize the Editor with the file stream and load options for word processing documents
    using (Editor editor = new Editor(fs, new WordProcessingLoadOptions()))
    {
        // Proceed to edit the document
    }
}
```
**Explanation:** 
- **`FileStream fs`:** Opens a read-only access to your document.
- **`WordProcessingLoadOptions()`:** Sets options specific for loading word processing documents.

### Edit the Document

**Overview:** Convert the loaded Word document into an editable format to extract HTML content.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument document = editor.Edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions()))
{
    // Extract and manipulate HTML content
}
```
**Explanation:**
- **`WordProcessingEditOptions()`:** Defines options tailored for editing word processing documents.
- **Return Value:** An `EditableDocument`, which provides access to the document's internal representation.

### Extract HTML Content

**Overview:** Finally, extract the HTML content from the EditableDocument object.
```csharp
string htmlContent = document.GetContent();
// Output or further process the extracted HTML as needed
```
**Explanation:**
- **`GetContent()`:** Retrieves the full HTML representation of your Word document.
- **Usage:** This extracted HTML can be used for web display, storage, or further processing.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
