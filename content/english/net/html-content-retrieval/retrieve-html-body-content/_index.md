## Import Namespaces
To get started with GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This will allow you to access the classes and methods required for document editing.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## Step 1: Initialize the Editor
The first step in our process is to initialize the `Editor` class with your document. This class is the entry point for all editing operations.

You need to load the document you wish to edit. For this example, we'll use a sample Word document.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor("Your Sample Document", delegate { return new WordProcessingLoadOptions(); }))
{
    // Continue to the next step
}
```
## Step 2: Edit the Document
Next, we'll use the `Edit` method of the `Editor` class to create an editable version of the document.

We'll specify the editing options for the document. In this case, we'll use `WordProcessingEditOptions`.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument document = editor.Edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions()))
{
    // Continue to the next step
}
```
## Step 3: Retrieve HTML Body Content
Now, we will retrieve the body content of the document in HTML format. This is where the magic happens!

Using the `GetBodyContent` method, we can extract the inner content of the HTML `<body>` element.
```csharp
string bodyContent = document.GetBodyContent();
Console.WriteLine("Inner content of the HTML->BODY element: {0}", bodyContent);
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to retrieve HTML body content from a document using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET. This powerful library simplifies document editing within your .NET applications, making it a valuable tool for developers.
