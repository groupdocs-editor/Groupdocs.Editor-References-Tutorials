# Set License from Stream

## Introduction
Are you looking for a powerful way to edit documents programmatically in your .NET applications? Look no further! Groupdocs.Editor for .NET is a robust document editing solution that allows you to seamlessly integrate document editing features into your applications. Whether you're handling Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or other formats, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the exciting world of document editing with Groupdocs.Editor for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to ensure a smooth setup:
1. .NET Framework: Ensure that you have .NET Framework 4.7.1 or higher installed on your machine.
2. Groupdocs.Editor for .NET: Download and install the latest version from the [release page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
3. IDE: Have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio ready.
4. License: Obtain a valid license for Groupdocs.Editor. You can get a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for evaluation purposes.
## Import Namespaces
To start using Groupdocs.Editor for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. This will ensure that all the required classes and methods are available for you to use.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor;
```

Setting up the license is the first critical step in using Groupdocs.Editor for .NET. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:
## Step 1: Check License File
First, ensure that you have the license file downloaded from Groupdocs. Typically, the license file will be named something like `GroupDocs.Editor.lic`.
## Step 2: Load License from Stream
Now, let's load the license using a file stream. This ensures that the license is applied correctly when your application starts.
```csharp
if (File.Exists("path/to/your/GroupDocs.Editor.lic"))
{
    using (FileStream stream = File.OpenRead("path/to/your/GroupDocs.Editor.lic"))
    {
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense(stream);
    }
    Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nWe do not ship any license with this example. " +
                      "\nVisit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
                      "\nLearn more about licensing at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing. " +
                      "\nLearn how to request a temporary license at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license.");
}
```
This snippet checks for the existence of the license file and sets it up if found.
## Loading and Editing a Document
With the license in place, let’s move on to loading and editing a document. This will be broken down into clear, manageable steps.
## Step 1: Load the Document
Load the document you want to edit. For example, let's start with a Word document.
```csharp
string filePath = "path/to/your/document.docx";
Editor editor = new Editor(filePath);
```
## Step 2: Extract Editable Content
Next, extract the content from the document into an editable format.
```csharp
EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit();
string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
```
## Step 3: Modify the Content
Now, you can modify the content as needed. For this example, let's just append some text.
```csharp
string modifiedContent = content + "\nAppended text";
editableDocument.SetContent(modifiedContent);
```
## Step 4: Save the Modified Document
Finally, save the modified document back to the file system.
```csharp
using (MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    editor.Save(editableDocument, outputStream, new WordProcessingSaveOptions());
    File.WriteAllBytes("path/to/your/modified_document.docx", outputStream.ToArray());
}
```
## Working with Different Formats
Groupdocs.Editor for .NET supports various document formats. Here's a quick guide to working with some common formats.
## Editing Excel Spreadsheets
Editing Excel files is similar to Word documents. The main difference is in the save options.
```csharp
string filePath = "path/to/your/spreadsheet.xlsx";
Editor editor = new Editor(filePath);
// Extract content
EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit();
string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
// Modify content
string modifiedContent = content + "\nNew data row";
editableDocument.SetContent(modifiedContent);
// Save the modified document
using (MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    editor.Save(editableDocument, outputStream, new SpreadsheetSaveOptions());
    File.WriteAllBytes("path/to/your/modified_spreadsheet.xlsx", outputStream.ToArray());
}
```
## Editing PDF Documents
PDF documents require a slightly different approach due to their nature.
```csharp
string filePath = "path/to/your/document.pdf";
Editor editor = new Editor(filePath);
// Extract content
EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit();
string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
// Modify content
string modifiedContent = content + "\nAdditional text";
editableDocument.SetContent(modifiedContent);
// Save the modified document
using (MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    editor.Save(editableDocument, outputStream, new PdfSaveOptions());
    File.WriteAllBytes("path/to/your/modified_document.pdf", outputStream.ToArray());
}
```
## Advanced Features
Groupdocs.Editor for .NET offers several advanced features that can enhance your document editing capabilities.
## Setting Save Options
You can customize the save options to fit your requirements. For example, when saving a Word document, you can specify the format and other details.
```csharp
WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions
{
    Format = WordProcessingFormats.Docx,
    Password = "your-password"
};
editor.Save(editableDocument, outputStream, saveOptions);
```
## Handling Large Documents
For large documents, consider using streaming to handle content efficiently.
```csharp
using (FileStream inputStream = File.OpenRead("path/to/large/document.docx"))
{
    Editor editor = new Editor(() => inputStream);
    EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit();
    
    // Modify content
    string modifiedContent = editableDocument.GetContent() + "\nAdditional content";
    editableDocument.SetContent(modifiedContent);
    
    using (MemoryStream outputStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        editor.Save(editableDocument, outputStream, new WordProcessingSaveOptions());
        File.WriteAllBytes("path/to/modified_large_document.docx", outputStream.ToArray());
    }
}
```
