## Import Namespaces
To get started with GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you'll need to import the necessary namespaces. This ensures that you have access to all the classes and methods required for document editing.
```csharp

using System.IO;
```
These namespaces will allow you to perform various document editing tasks, such as loading, editing, and saving documents.
## Step 1: Install GroupDocs.Editor for .NET
First, you need to install GroupDocs.Editor for .NET. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio:
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new project or open an existing one.
2. Navigate to the NuGet Package Manager: Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.
3. Search for GroupDocs.Editor and install the latest version.
This will add the necessary DLLs to your project, allowing you to use GroupDocs.Editor functionality.
## Step 2: Set License
To unlock the full potential of GroupDocs.Editor, you need to set the license. This can be done by loading the license file from your system.
```csharp
if (File.Exists(Constants.LicensePath))
{
    License license = new License();
    license.SetLicense(Constants.LicensePath);
    Console.WriteLine("License set successfully.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("\nWe do not ship any license with this example. " +
                      "\nVisit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
                      "\nLearn more about licensing at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing. " +
                      "\nLearn how to request a temporary license at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license.");
}
```
Replace `Constants.LicensePath` with the path to your license file. This step is crucial to avoid any limitations during document editing. 
## Step 3: Load a Document
With your environment set up, you can now load a document. GroupDocs.Editor supports various formats, including DOCX, PDF, and HTML.
```csharp
// Load a DOCX file
string filePath = "path/to/your/document.docx";
EditableDocument document = Editor.FromFile(filePath);
```
This code snippet loads a DOCX file from the specified path and prepares it for editing.
## Step 4: Edit the Document
Once the document is loaded, you can proceed to edit its content. You can manipulate the document as needed using various methods provided by GroupDocs.Editor.
```csharp
// Edit the document
string content = document.GetContent();
content = content.Replace("old text", "new text");
// Apply the changes back to the document
EditableDocument editedDocument = EditableDocument.FromContent(content);
```
Here, we retrieve the content of the document, make some modifications, and then apply those changes back to the document.
## Step 5: Save the Edited Document
After editing the document, the final step is to save the changes. You can save the document in the original format or convert it to another supported format.
```csharp
// Save the edited document
string outputPath = "path/to/your/edited_document.docx";
using (FileStream outputStream = File.Create(outputPath))
{
    Editor.ToDocument(editedDocument, outputStream);
}
```
This code saves the edited document to the specified path.
