### Extracting External CSS Content from a Document

#### Overview
This feature allows you to access and extract external CSS stylesheets embedded within a Word document using GroupDocs.Editor, enabling further manipulation or integration into your web applications.

##### Step 1: Initialize the Editor with Your Document
Begin by initializing the `Editor` class with the path to your Word document. This step is crucial as it prepares your document for editing and extraction operations.

```csharp
// Initialize the Editor with a sample document.
Editor editor = new Editor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.docx", new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

##### Step 2: Open the Document for Editing
Use the `Edit` method to open the document, allowing access to its content and associated resources like CSS stylesheets.

##### Step 3: Retrieve External CSS Stylesheets
Extract the external CSS content using the `GetCssContent` method. This returns a list of CSS stylesheets associated with your document.
