## Implementation Guide

### Extracting HTML Content from a Word Document

This feature lets you extract and manipulate the HTML content of a Word document.

#### Step 1: Load the Document
Start by loading your document, using specific load options if needed.

```csharp
// Create load options for any special settings
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();

using (Editor editor = new Editor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX", () => loadOptions))
{
    // Load the document
}
```

#### Step 2: Extract HTML Content
Convert your Word document into HTML format.

```csharp
// Create edit options to specify editing as HTML
WordProcessingEditOptions editOptions = new WordProcessingEditOptions();

using (EditableDocument document = editor.Edit(editOptions))
{
    string htmlContent = document.GetContent();
    
    // Work with your HTML content
}
```

#### Step 3: Apply Custom Prefixes
Customize external resources by applying prefixes to images and CSS links within the extracted HTML.

```csharp
// Modify HTML content directly for custom prefixes
string modifiedHtml = htmlContent.Replace("src=\"", "src=\"https://yourdomain.com/images/")
                                .Replace("href=\"styles.css\"", "href=\"https://yourdomain.com/css/styles.css\"");
