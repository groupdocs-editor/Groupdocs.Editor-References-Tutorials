## Implementation Guide
Now that you're set up, let’s walk through implementing each feature of GroupDocs.Editor.

### Loading a PDF Document
**Overview:**
Loading a PDF is your first step in the editing process. This involves creating a stream from the file path and using load options if necessary.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Create Stream from File Path**
   Define a method to asynchronously open your PDF document as a stream.

   ```csharp
   async Task<Stream> LoadDocumentAsync(string inputFilePath)
   {
       return await File.OpenRead(inputFilePath).AsTask();
   }
   ```

2. **Creating Load Options for Password-Protected PDFs**
   If your PDF requires a password, create load options to handle this:

   ```csharp
   PdfLoadOptions CreateLoadOptions()
   {
       var loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
       loadOptions.Password = "your_password_here"; // Optional if the document is protected
       return loadOptions;
   }
   ```

### Editing a PDF Document
**Overview:**
Editing involves extracting content, making changes, and creating an editable version of your document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Create Edit Options**
   Enable pagination for better results when editing.

   ```csharp
   PdfEditOptions CreateEditOptions()
   {
       var editOptions = new PdfEditOptions();
       editOptions.EnablePagination = true;
       return editOptions;
   }
   ```

2. **Load, Edit and Extract Content**
   Use the Editor class to load your document, apply editing options, and modify content.

   ```csharp
   async Task<EditableDocument> LoadAndEditPdfAsync(string inputFilePath)
   {
       var loadOptions = CreateLoadOptions();
       var editOptions = CreateEditOptions();

       using (var editor = new Editor(await LoadDocumentAsync(inputFilePath), loadOptions))
       {
           EditableDocument beforeEdit = await Task.Run(() => editor.Edit(editOptions));
           string originalContent = beforeEdit.GetContent();
           
           // Modify content example
           string editedContent = originalContent.Replace("document", "edited document");
           
           return EditableDocument.FromMarkup(editedContent, beforeEdit.AllResources);
       }
   }
   ```

### Saving a PDF Document after Editing
**Overview:**
Once your edits are complete, save the document with options like encryption and memory optimization.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Create Save Options**
   Configure how you want to save the edited document, including password protection if needed.

   ```csharp
   PdfSaveOptions CreateSaveOptions()
   {
       var saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
       saveOptions.Password = "new_password"; // Optional for encryption
       saveOptions.OptimizeMemoryUsage = true;
       return saveOptions;
   }
   ```

2. **Save the Edited Document**
   Write the changes to a file using the specified options.

   ```csharp
   async Task SaveEditedPdfAsync(EditableDocument afterEdit, string outputPath)
   {
       using (var outputStream = File.Create(outputPath))
       {
           await Task.Run(() => afterEdit.Save(outputStream, CreateSaveOptions()));
       }
   }
   ```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Editor can transform how you handle PDFs in various scenarios:
