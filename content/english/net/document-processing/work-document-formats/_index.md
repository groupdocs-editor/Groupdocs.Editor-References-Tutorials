## Introduction
Welcome to our in-depth guide on using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET! If you're a developer looking to enhance your applications with document editing capabilities, you've come to the right place. This article will walk you through everything you need to know, from prerequisites to practical examples, to get you up and running with this powerful library.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the examples and functionalities of GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Basic Understanding of .NET: Familiarity with .NET Framework or .NET Core is essential.
2. Development Environment: Visual Studio or any other suitable .NET IDE.
3. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET Library: Download the library from the [GroupDocs releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
4. Temporary License: Obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) for full features.
## Import Namespaces
To get started with GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. This will ensure you have access to all the classes and methods provided by the library.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```

## Step 1: Working with Document Formats
GroupDocs.Editor supports a wide range of document formats. Let’s explore how you can list all supported Word Processing and Presentation formats.
### Listing Word Processing Formats
```csharp
foreach (Formats.WordProcessingFormats oneFormat in Formats.WordProcessingFormats.All)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name is {0}, extension is {1}", oneFormat.Name, oneFormat.Extension);
}
```
Explanation:
1. Loop Through Formats: We loop through all available Word Processing formats.
2. Output Format Details: For each format, we print its name and extension.
### Listing Presentation Formats
```csharp
foreach (Formats.PresentationFormats oneFormat in Formats.PresentationFormats.All)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name is {0}, extension is {1}", oneFormat.Name, oneFormat.Extension);
}
```
Explanation:
1. Loop Through Formats: Similar to Word Processing formats, we loop through all Presentation formats.
2. Output Format Details: Print the name and extension of each format.
## Step 2: Parsing Formats from Extensions
Sometimes, you need to determine the format based on a file extension. GroupDocs.Editor makes this easy.
### Parsing Spreadsheet Formats
```csharp
Formats.SpreadsheetFormats expectedXlsm = Formats.SpreadsheetFormats.FromExtension(".xlsm");
Console.WriteLine("Parsed Spreadsheet format is {0}", expectedXlsm.Name);
```
Explanation:
1. Parse Format: We use the `FromExtension` method to parse the format from the `.xlsm` extension.
2. Output Format: Print the parsed format’s name.
### Parsing Textual Formats
```csharp
Formats.TextualFormats expectedHtml = Formats.TextualFormats.FromExtension("html");
Console.WriteLine("Parsed Textual format is {0}", expectedHtml.Name);
```
Explanation:
1. Parse Format: The `FromExtension` method is used to parse the format from the `html` extension.
2. Output Format: Print the name of the parsed textual format.
## Step 3: Editing Documents
Now that we've seen how to work with formats, let's dive into editing documents using GroupDocs.Editor.
### Loading a Document
To edit a document, you first need to load it.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor("path/to/your/document.docx"))
{
    // Further steps will be covered here.
}
```
Explanation:
1. Initialize Editor: Create an instance of the `Editor` class, providing the path to your document.
2. Dispose Pattern: Use the `using` statement to ensure resources are properly disposed of.
### Extracting Content
Once the document is loaded, you can extract its content for editing.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit())
{
    string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
    Console.WriteLine(content);
}
```
Explanation:
1. Edit Method: Call the `Edit` method to get an `EditableDocument`.
2. Get Content: Use `GetContent` to retrieve the document’s content as a string.
3. Output Content: Print the content to the console.
### Saving Changes
After editing, save your changes back to the document.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit())
{
    // Modify content here
    SaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Docx);
    editor.Save(editableDocument, "path/to/save/document.docx", saveOptions);
}
```
Explanation:
1. Edit Method: Call the `Edit` method to get an `EditableDocument`.
2. Modify Content: Modify the content as needed (not shown in this snippet).
3. Save Options: Create `SaveOptions` specifying the format.
4. Save Document: Use the `Save` method to save the edited document.
## Step 4: Working with Different Document Types
GroupDocs.Editor supports various document types. Here’s how to work with them:
### Editing Spreadsheet Documents
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor("path/to/your/spreadsheet.xlsx"))
{
    using (EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit())
    {
        string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
        Console.WriteLine(content);
        // Modify content here
        SaveOptions saveOptions = new SpreadsheetSaveOptions(SpreadsheetFormats.Xlsx);
        editor.Save(editableDocument, "path/to/save/spreadsheet.xlsx", saveOptions);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
1. Initialize Editor: Create an `Editor` instance for a spreadsheet.

{
    using (EditableDocument editableDocument = editor.Edit())
    {
        string content = editableDocument.GetContent();
        Console.WriteLine(content);
        // Modify content here
        SaveOptions saveOptions = new PresentationSaveOptions(PresentationFormats.Pptx);
        editor.Save(editableDocument, "path/to/save/presentation.pptx", saveOptions);
    }
}
```
Explanation:
1. Initialize Editor: Create an `Editor` instance for a presentation.
2. Edit Method: Call `Edit` to get an `EditableDocument`.
3. Get Content: Retrieve and print the content.
