## Introduction
Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to work with word processing documents using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial will provide you with all the necessary information to manipulate and manage Word documents efficiently. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET is a powerful library designed to handle complex document editing tasks. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to seamlessly load, edit, and save Word documents within your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the coding steps, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. Visual Studio is highly recommended.
2. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET: Download and install the latest version from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
3. License: Obtain a free trial or purchase a license from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy). You can also request a temporary license [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you follow along with the examples.
## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Formats;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Resources;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## Step 1: Get the Input File Path
First, identify the path to the input Word document. For this tutorial, we'll use a sample DOCX file.
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YourSampleDocument.docx";
```
## Step 2: Create a Stream from the Input File Path
Next, create a file stream to read the input document.
```csharp
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead(inputFilePath))
{
    // Proceed with further steps
}
```
## Step 3: Create Load Options for the Document
Define the load options for your document. If the document is password-protected, specify the password here. 
```csharp
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions
{
    Password = "some_password_to_open_a_document" // Optional, only if the document is protected
};
```
## Step 4: Load the Document into the Editor Instance
Use the Editor instance to load the document with the specified options.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor(() => fs, () => loadOptions))
{
    // Continue to the next step
}
```
## Step 5: Create Editing Options
Set up the editing options to customize how the document will be processed.
```csharp
WordProcessingEditOptions editOptions = new WordProcessingEditOptions
{
    FontExtraction = FontExtractionOptions.ExtractEmbeddedWithoutSystem,
    EnableLanguageInformation = true,
    EnablePagination = true
};
```
## Step 6: Create an Editable Document
Generate an intermediate EditableDocument from the original document.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.Edit(editOptions))
{
    // Move to the next step
}
```
## Step 7: Extract Textual Content as HTML
Extract the textual content and resources of the document as HTML markup.
```csharp
string originalContent = beforeEdit.GetContent();
List<IHtmlResource> allResources = beforeEdit.AllResources;
```
## Step 8: Modify the Content
Modify the HTML content as required. In this example, we'll simply replace the word "document" with "edited document".
```csharp
string editedContent = originalContent.Replace("document", "edited document");
```
## Step 9: Create a New EditableDocument with Edited Content
Create a new EditableDocument instance using the modified content.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument afterEdit = EditableDocument.FromMarkup(editedContent, allResources))
{
    // Proceed to saving the document
}
```
## Step 10: Create Document Save Options
Define the options for saving the document, including password protection and pagination.
```csharp
WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Docm)
{
    Password = "password",
    EnablePagination = true,
    Locale = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US"),
    OptimizeMemoryUsage = true,
    Protection = new WordProcessingProtection(WordProcessingProtectionType.ReadOnly, "write_password")
};
```
## Step 11: Save the Edited Document
Finally, save the edited document to the desired location.
```csharp
string outputFilename = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(inputFilePath) + ".docm";
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YourOutputDirectory", outputFilename);
using (FileStream outputStream = File.Create(outputPath))
{
    editor.Save(afterEdit, outputStream, saveOptions);
}
Console.WriteLine("Document editing and saving process completed successfully.");
```
