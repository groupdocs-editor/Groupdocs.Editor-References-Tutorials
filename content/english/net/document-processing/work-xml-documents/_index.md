## Introduction
In today's digital world, managing and editing XML documents efficiently is crucial for developers and businesses alike. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET offers a powerful and versatile solution for editing XML files programmatically. This tutorial will guide you through the process of working with XML documents using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, breaking down each step to make it easy and comprehensible.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the steps, let's ensure you have everything you need to get started.
1. Development Environment: Ensure you have a development environment set up. Visual Studio is highly recommended.
2. .NET Framework: GroupDocs.Editor for .NET supports multiple .NET frameworks. Make sure your project targets one of the supported versions.
3. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET: Download and install GroupDocs.Editor for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
4. License: While you can use a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/), it is recommended to purchase a full license for full functionality from the [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).
5. Sample XML File: Have a sample XML file ready that you would like to edit.
## Import Namespaces
Before starting with the code, you need to import the necessary namespaces. These will allow you to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Editor for .NET.
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Formats;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Resources;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Serialization;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## 1. Load the Input XML File
The first step is to load your input XML file. This will serve as the document that you want to edit.
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "Your Sample Document.xml";
```
## 2. Create an Editor Instance
Next, create an instance of the `Editor` class. This class is the core component that will handle the editing of your document.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath))
{
    // Continue with the following steps within this using block
}
```
## 3. Set Up XML Editing Options
Configure the XML editing options to suit your needs. These options determine how the XML content will be processed.
```csharp
XmlEditOptions editOptions = new XmlEditOptions
{
    AttributeValuesQuoteType = QuoteType.DoubleQuote,
    RecognizeEmails = true,
    RecognizeUris = true,
    TrimTrailingWhitespaces = true
};
```
## 4. Create an Editable Document Instance
Generate an `EditableDocument` instance, which represents the XML document in an editable form.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.Edit(editOptions))
{
    // Proceed with editing the document
}
```
## 5. Edit the Document Content
You can now modify the content of your XML document as needed. For example, replacing text within the document.
```csharp
string originalTextContent = beforeEdit.GetContent();
string updatedTextContent = originalTextContent.Replace("John", "Samuel");
List<IHtmlResource> allResources = beforeEdit.AllResources;
```
## 6. Create an Editable Document with Updated Content
After making the necessary edits, create a new `EditableDocument` instance with the updated content.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument afterEdit = EditableDocument.FromMarkup(updatedTextContent, allResources))
{
    // Prepare for saving the document
}
```
## 7. Configure Save Options for Different Formats
GroupDocs.Editor allows you to save the edited document in various formats. Here, we will set up options for saving in DOCX and TXT formats.
```csharp
WordProcessingSaveOptions wordSaveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Docx);
TextSaveOptions txtSaveOptions = new TextSaveOptions
{
    Encoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8
};
```
## 8. Prepare Output Paths
Specify the paths where the edited documents will be saved.
```csharp
string outputWordPath = Path.Combine(Constants.GetOutputDirectoryPath(inputFilePath), Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(inputFilePath) + ".docx");
string outputTxtPath = Path.Combine(Constants.GetOutputDirectoryPath(inputFilePath), Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(inputFilePath) + ".txt");
```
## 9. Save the Edited Document
Finally, save the edited document to the specified paths using the save options configured earlier.
```csharp
editor.Save(afterEdit, outputWordPath, wordSaveOptions);
editor.Save(afterEdit, outputTxtPath, txtSaveOptions);
```
## 10. Complete the Process
Upon completion, print a confirmation message to the console.
```csharp
System.Console.WriteLine("WorkingWithXml routine has successfully finished");
```
