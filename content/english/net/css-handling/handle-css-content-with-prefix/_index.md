# Handle CSS Content with Prefix

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we’ll dive deep into how to handle CSS content with a prefix using Groupdocs.Editor for .NET. This powerful tool enables you to manage and manipulate documents with ease. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this guide will walk you through each step in a simple and engaging manner.
## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Visual Studio: You’ll need a working installation of Visual Studio.
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed.
- Groupdocs.Editor for .NET: You can download it [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
- Sample Document: Have a sample document ready for editing.
## Import Namespaces
First, let’s import the necessary namespaces to ensure our code runs smoothly. This is a crucial step to access all the functionalities provided by Groupdocs.Editor for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## Step 1: Initialize the Editor
The first step involves initializing the `Editor` class with your sample document. This sets up the environment to start editing your document.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor("Your Sample Document", delegate { return new WordProcessingLoadOptions(); }))
{
```
## Step 2: Edit the Document
Next, we need to create an `EditableDocument` instance. This is where the magic happens - enabling us to manipulate the document’s content.
```csharp
    using (EditableDocument document = editor.Edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions()))
    {
```
## Step 3: Set External Prefixes
Here, we define the external prefixes for images and fonts. This is particularly useful if you’re referencing external resources hosted on a web server.
```csharp
        string externalImagesPrefix = "http://www.mywebsite.com/images/id=";
        string externalFontsPrefix = "http://www.mywebsite.com/fonts/id=";
```
## Step 4: Get CSS Content
Now, we fetch the CSS content from the document. This method returns a list of CSS stylesheets, applying the prefixes we defined earlier.
```csharp
        List<string> stylesheets = document.GetCssContent(externalImagesPrefix, externalFontsPrefix);
```
## Step 5: Output the Results
Finally, we output the number of stylesheets found and print each stylesheet to the console. This helps in verifying that the prefixes are correctly applied and the CSS content is retrieved successfully.
```csharp
        Console.WriteLine("There are {0} stylesheets in the input document", stylesheets.Count);
        foreach (string css in stylesheets)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(css);
        }
    }
}
```
## Conclusion
Handling CSS content with prefixes using Groupdocs.Editor for .NET is straightforward and efficient. By following these steps, you can easily manage your document's stylesheets and ensure they tutorials the correct external resources. This tutorial has covered the essential steps to get you started, but Groupdocs.Editor for .NET offers much more. Explore its documentation and features to fully leverage its capabilities in your projects.
