## Introduction
Ever found yourself tangled in the complexity of document editing within your .NET applications? Fear not! With GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you have a powerful ally to simplify this task. This comprehensive guide will walk you through how to leverage this robust tool to edit documents with ease. Whether you are dealing with Word Processing documents or Spreadsheets, by the end of this tutorial, you'll be navigating GroupDocs.Editor like a pro.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- Visual Studio: Installed and ready to go.
- .NET Framework: A compatible version installed on your system.
- GroupDocs.Editor for .NET: You can [download the latest version](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/) and obtain a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) if needed.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: This guide assumes you have a foundational understanding of C# and .NET development.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your project. Add the following lines at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Resources;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Resources.Images;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
Now that you're all set up, let's break down the document editing process into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Load a Word Processing Document
First, let's load a Word Processing document. This is where you point the Editor instance to your document's location and specify any load options if necessary.
### 1.1 Initialize the Editor with Default Options
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "Your Sample Document"; // Path to your document
Editor editor1 = new Editor(inputFilePath, delegate { return new WordProcessingLoadOptions(); });
```
This code snippet initializes the Editor instance using default load options for a Word Processing document.
## Step 2: Edit the Document
Now, we can proceed to edit the loaded document. GroupDocs.Editor allows you to customize the editing options to suit your needs.
### 2.1 Edit with Default Options
```csharp
EditableDocument defaultWordProcessingDoc = editor1.Edit();
```
Editing the document with default options is straightforward and requires minimal configuration.
### 2.2 Edit with Custom Options
Let's dive into more advanced configurations by specifying custom editing options.
```csharp
WordProcessingEditOptions wordProcessingEditOptions1 = new WordProcessingEditOptions();
wordProcessingEditOptions1.EnablePagination = false;
wordProcessingEditOptions1.EnableLanguageInformation = true;
wordProcessingEditOptions1.FontExtraction = FontExtractionOptions.ExtractAllEmbedded;
EditableDocument version1WordProcessingDoc = editor1.Edit(wordProcessingEditOptions1);
```
In this snippet, we disabled pagination, enabled language information, and set font extraction to extract all embedded fonts.
### 2.3 Another Configuration Example
You can also edit the document with a different set of options:
```csharp
WordProcessingEditOptions wordProcessingEditOptions2 = new WordProcessingEditOptions(true);
wordProcessingEditOptions2.FontExtraction = FontExtractionOptions.ExtractAll;
EditableDocument version2WordProcessingDoc = editor1.Edit(wordProcessingEditOptions2);
```
Here, we enabled pagination and set font extraction to extract all fonts.
## Step 3: Load and Edit a Spreadsheet
Editing spreadsheets is equally straightforward with GroupDocs.Editor.
### 3.1 Load the Spreadsheet
```csharp
Editor editor2 = new Editor("Your Sample Document", delegate { return new SpreadsheetLoadOptions(); });
```
This initializes an Editor instance for a spreadsheet document.
### 3.2 Edit the First Tab
```csharp
SpreadsheetEditOptions sheetTab1EditOptions = new SpreadsheetEditOptions();
sheetTab1EditOptions.WorksheetIndex = 0; // Index is 0-based, so this is the first tab
EditableDocument firstTab = editor2.Edit(sheetTab1EditOptions);
```
You can edit the first tab of the spreadsheet using the options specified.
### 3.3 Edit the Second Tab
```csharp
SpreadsheetEditOptions sheetTab2EditOptions = new SpreadsheetEditOptions();
sheetTab2EditOptions.WorksheetIndex = 1; // Index is 0-based, so this is the second tab
EditableDocument secondTab = editor2.Edit(sheetTab2EditOptions);
```
Similarly, this code snippet edits the second tab of the spreadsheet.
## Step 4: Extracting Content
Once you have edited your document, you may need to extract its content. GroupDocs.Editor provides various methods for this.
### 4.1 Get HTML Content
```csharp
string bodyContent = firstTab.GetBodyContent(); // HTML markup from inside the HTML->BODY element
string allContent = firstTab.GetContent(); // Full HTML markup of all document, including HTML->HEAD header and its content
```
This code extracts the HTML content of the edited document.
### 4.2 Extract Resources
```csharp
List<IImageResource> onlyImages = firstTab.Images;
List<IHtmlResource> allResourcesTogether = firstTab.AllResources;
```
Here, you can extract images and all other HTML resources from the document.
## Step 5: Clean Up
Don't forget to dispose of all instances to free up resources.
```csharp
defaultWordProcessingDoc.Dispose();
version1WordProcessingDoc.Dispose();
version2WordProcessingDoc.Dispose();
firstTab.Dispose();
secondTab.Dispose();
editor1.Dispose();
editor2.Dispose();
```
Proper disposal ensures there are no memory leaks or performance issues in your application.
