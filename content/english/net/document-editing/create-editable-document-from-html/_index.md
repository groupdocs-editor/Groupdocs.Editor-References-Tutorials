# Create Editable Document from HTML

## Introduction
Are you looking to transform your static HTML files into dynamic, editable Word documents? With GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you can seamlessly convert HTML into various editable formats with ease. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process step by step, ensuring that you can accomplish this task effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, let's ensure you have everything you need:
- GroupDocs.Editor for .NET: Download and install the latest version from the [GroupDocs releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/).
- .NET Framework: Make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your machine.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Visual Studio or any other .NET-compatible IDE.
- Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will be beneficial.
## Import Namespaces
To begin, youâ€™ll need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# project. These namespaces provide the classes and methods required to work with GroupDocs.Editor for .NET.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Formats;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## Step 1: Load the HTML File
First, we need to load the HTML file that you want to convert into an editable Word document. This is done using the `EditableDocument` class from GroupDocs.Editor.

```csharp
string htmlFilePath = "Your Sample Document";
using (EditableDocument document = EditableDocument.FromFile(htmlFilePath, null))
{
    // Further processing will be done here
}
```
In this step, replace `"Your Sample Document"` with the actual path of your HTML file. The `EditableDocument.FromFile` method loads the HTML content into an `EditableDocument` object.
## Step 2: Initialize the Editor
With the HTML content loaded into an `EditableDocument` object, the next step is to initialize the `Editor` class. This class provides various methods for editing and converting documents.

```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor(htmlFilePath))
{
    // Further processing will be done here
}
```
The `Editor` class requires the path to the HTML file. This allows the editor to access and manipulate the file's content.
## Step 3: Set the Save Options
Before saving the document, you need to define the save options. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET supports various output formats. In this example, we'll convert the HTML file to a DOCX format, which is a common Word document format.

```csharp
Options.WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Docx);
```
The `WordProcessingSaveOptions` class allows you to specify the output format. Here, we are setting it to `WordProcessingFormats.Docx` to convert the HTML to a DOCX file.
## Step 4: Define the Save Path
Next, define the path where the converted file will be saved. This involves combining the directory path with the desired file name and extension.

```csharp
string savePath = Path.Combine(Constants.GetOutputDirectoryPath(htmlFilePath), Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(htmlFilePath) + ".docx");
```
The `Path.Combine` method is used to create a full path by combining the output directory path and the file name without its extension, adding the `.docx` extension.
## Step 5: Save the Document
The final step is to save the document using the `Editor` class and the defined save options and path.

```csharp
editor.Save(document, savePath, saveOptions);
```
This command takes the `EditableDocument` object, the save path, and the save options as parameters, and saves the HTML content as a DOCX file.
