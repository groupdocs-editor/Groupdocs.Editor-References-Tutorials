```

## Implementation Guide
We’ll break down the implementation into key features: document loading and editing, resource extraction, and content access.

### Document Loading and Editing
This feature allows you to load a document and create an `EditableDocument` instance for manipulation.

#### Step 1: Initialize Editor
Initialize the editor with your document path:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path
Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath, new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

#### Step 2: Create EditableDocument Instance
Configure options and create an editable instance:
```csharp
WordProcessingEditOptions editOptions = new WordProcessingEditOptions { FontExtraction = FontExtractionOptions.ExtractAll };
EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.Edit(editOptions);
beforeEdit.Dispose();
editor.Dispose();
```

### Resource Extraction and Information Display
Extract images, fonts, and stylesheets from the `EditableDocument`.

#### Step 1: Gather Resources
Access resources from your document:
```csharp
List<IImageResource> images = beforeEdit.Images;
List<FontResourceBase> fonts = beforeEdit.Fonts;
List<CssText> stylesheets = beforeEdit.Css;
```

#### Step 2: Save Extracted Resources
Save the extracted resources to a specified directory:
```csharp
string outputFolderPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "Resources");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolderPath);

foreach (var image in images)
{
    string imagePath = Path.Combine(outputFolderPath, image.FilenameWithExtension);
    image.Save(imagePath);
}

foreach (var font in fonts)
{
    string fontPath = Path.Combine(outputFolderPath, font.FilenameWithExtension);
    font.Save(fontPath);
}

foreach (var stylesheet in stylesheets)
{
    string stylesheetPath = Path.Combine(outputFolderPath, stylesheet.FilenameWithExtension);
    stylesheet.Save(stylesheetPath);
}
```

### Resource Content Access
Access content of resources as byte streams or base64-encoded strings.

#### Step 1: Access Byte Stream and Base64 String
```csharp
Stream imageStream = images[0].ByteContent; // Get byte stream of the first image
string base64EncodedResource = images[0].TextContent; // Get base64 string of the first image
```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Editor .NET can be integrated into various systems to enhance document management workflows:
1. **Automated Document Processing**: Streamline content extraction and editing in bulk processing scenarios.
2. **Customized Report Generation**: Modify document templates programmatically for dynamic report creation.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Integrate resource extraction features to manage media assets efficiently.

## Performance Considerations
Optimizing performance is crucial when working with GroupDocs.Editor:
