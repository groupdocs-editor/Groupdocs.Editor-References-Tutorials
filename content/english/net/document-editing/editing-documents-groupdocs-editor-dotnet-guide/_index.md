        {
            // Initialize GroupDocs.Editor
            using (Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Editor initialized successfully.");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialization failed: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that you have GroupDocs.Editor set up, let's explore its features.

### Loading a Document
**Overview:**
Loading documents is the first step in editing. This feature allows you to load any document from a specified file path into your .NET application using GroupDocs.Editor.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize Editor:**
   - Create an instance of the `Editor` class with the document's file path.
   
   ```csharp
   string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
   Editor editor;
   try
   {
       // Load the input document
       editor = new Editor(inputFilePath);
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Error loading document: " + ex.Message);
   }
   ```

### Editing a Document
**Overview:**
Once loaded, you can modify the document's content. This section covers retrieving and editing embedded HTML.

#### Steps:
1. **Open Document for Editing:**
   - Use the `Edit` method to prepare the document.
   
2. **Retrieve Content:**
   - Extract the document's HTML content using `GetEmbeddedHtml`.
   
3. **Modify Content:**
   - Perform text replacements or other edits on the HTML string.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Editor;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;

Editor editor; // Assume editor is already initialized
EditableDocument beforeEdit = null;
try
{
    // Open the document for editing
    beforeEdit = editor.Edit();
    
    // Retrieve content and resources
    string allEmbeddedInsideString = beforeEdit.GetEmbeddedHtml();
    
    // Modify the embedded HTML content
    string editedContent = allEmbeddedInsideString.Replace("Subtitle", "Edited subtitle");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error editing document: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    beforeEdit?.Dispose();
}
```

### Saving an Edited Document
**Overview:**
After editing, you may need to save the modified content back into a file. This feature demonstrates saving documents in RTF format.

#### Steps:
1. **Create EditableDocument:**
   - Use `FromMarkup` with your edited HTML content.
   
2. **Set Save Options:**
   - Choose the desired output format (e.g., RTF).
   
3. **Save Document:**
   - Implement saving logic using the `Editor.Save` method.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;

Editor editor; // Assume editor is already initialized
EditableDocument afterEdit = null;
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "edited_document.rtf");
try
{
    // Create a new EditableDocument from the edited content
    afterEdit = EditableDocument.FromMarkup(editedContent, null);
    
    // Prepare saving options for RTF format
    WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Rtf);
    
    // Save the document to a file
    editor.Save(afterEdit, outputPath, saveOptions);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error saving document: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    afterEdit?.Dispose();
    editor.Dispose();
}
```
