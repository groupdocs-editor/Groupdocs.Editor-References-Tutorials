# Introduction to GroupDocs.Editor for .NET

## Introduction 
If you're a developer looking to seamlessly integrate document editing capabilities into your .NET applications, GroupDocs.Editor for .NET is a powerful tool to consider. This versatile library enables you to load, edit, and save various document formats programmatically. Whether you need to handle Word documents, PDFs, or HTML files, GroupDocs.Editor simplifies the process, making it efficient and straightforward. In this tutorial, we'll explore the basics of using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, guiding you through a practical example step-by-step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Development Environment: Visual Studio 2017 or later.
- .NET Framework: .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later.
- GroupDocs.Editor for .NET: You can [download](https://releases.groupdocs.com/editor/net/) it from the site.
- License: A valid license or a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) from GroupDocs.
## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces. These namespaces will provide access to the classes and methods required for document editing.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Formats;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```

In this section, weâ€™ll break down the process into manageable steps, ensuring you understand each part of the workflow.
## Step 1: Get a Path to the Input File
First, you need to specify the path to the document you wish to edit. For this example, let's assume you have a DOCX file named "Your Sample Document.docx".
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "Your Sample Document.docx";
```
## Step 2: Instantiate the Editor Object
Next, create an instance of the `Editor` class by loading the input file. This step initializes the document for further processing.
```csharp
using (GroupDocs.Editor.Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath))
{
    // Subsequent steps will be nested inside this block
}
```
## Step 3: Open the Document for Editing
To edit the document, obtain an intermediate `EditableDocument` instance. This object allows you to manipulate the document content and associated resources.
```csharp
EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.Edit();
```
## Step 4: Retrieve Document Content and Resources
Extract the main content, images, fonts, and stylesheets from the editable document. This information is essential for making any modifications.
```csharp
string content = beforeEdit.GetContent();
var images = beforeEdit.Images;
var fonts = beforeEdit.Fonts;
var stylesheets = beforeEdit.Css;
```
### Step 4.1: Get Document as a Single Base64-Encoded String
You can also obtain the entire document content as a single base64-encoded string, which includes all resources.
```csharp
string allEmbeddedInsideString = beforeEdit.GetEmbeddedHtml();
```
### Step 4.2: Edit the Content
For demonstration purposes, let's modify the document content by replacing a specific text.
```csharp
string allEmbeddedInsideStringEdited = allEmbeddedInsideString.Replace("Subtitle", "Edited subtitle");
```
## Step 5: Create a New EditableDocument Instance
After editing the content, create a new `EditableDocument` instance using the modified content.
```csharp
EditableDocument afterEdit = EditableDocument.FromMarkup(allEmbeddedInsideStringEdited, null);
```
## Step 6: Save the Edited Document
Now, save the edited document to the desired output format. In this example, we'll save it as an RTF file.
### Step 6.1: Prepare the Output Path
Specify the path where you want to save the output document.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("Output Directory Path", Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(inputFilePath) + ".rtf");
```
### Step 6.2: Prepare Saving Options
Define the saving options, specifying the format you want to save the document in.
```csharp
Options.WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions(WordProcessingFormats.Rtf);
```
### Step 6.3: Save to Path
Save the edited document to the specified path.
```csharp
editor.Save(afterEdit, outputPath, saveOptions);
```
### Step 6.4: Save to a Stream
Alternatively, you can save the output document to any writable stream.
```csharp
using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
{
    editor.Save(afterEdit, ms, saveOptions);
}
```
## Step 7: Dispose of the Editor and EditableDocument Instances
Finally, clean up by disposing of the `EditableDocument` instances and the `Editor` object to free up resources.
```csharp
beforeEdit.Dispose();
afterEdit.Dispose();
editor.Dispose();
```
