## Introduction
In today's digital age, managing and editing documents efficiently is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. GroupDocs.Editor for .NET offers a powerful solution to seamlessly edit a variety of document formats. This guide will walk you through the process of extracting HTML content from an editable document using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how to implement this feature in your own projects.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio or any compatible .NET development environment
- .NET framework installed on your machine
- GroupDocs.Editor for .NET library
- A sample document to extract HTML content from
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
## Import Namespaces
To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your project. These namespaces provide the classes and methods required to work with GroupDocs.Editor for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;
```
## Step 1: Create a FileStream for Your Document
The first step is to create a `FileStream` object that opens the document you want to extract HTML content from. This stream will be used to read the document into the editor.
```csharp
using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead("Your Sample Document"))
{
    // Next steps will be placed here
}
```
## Step 2: Initialize the Editor
Within the `using` statement of the `FileStream`, you need to initialize the `Editor` object. The `Editor` class is responsible for loading and editing the document. You will also specify the load options appropriate for your document type. In this example, we are working with a WordProcessing document.
```csharp
using (Editor editor = new Editor(delegate { return fs; }, delegate { return new WordProcessingLoadOptions(); }))
{
    // Next steps will be placed here
}
```
## Step 3: Edit the Document
Now, you will use the `Editor` object to edit the document. This involves creating an `EditableDocument` object, which represents the editable version of the document. The `Edit` method of the `Editor` class is used here with specific edit options.
```csharp
using (EditableDocument document = editor.Edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions()))
{
    // Next steps will be placed here
}
```
## Step 4: Extract HTML Content
Finally, with the `EditableDocument` object in hand, you can extract the HTML content. The `GetContent` method of the `EditableDocument` class returns the document's content as an HTML string. For demonstration purposes, we'll print the first 200 characters of the HTML content.
```csharp
string htmlContent = document.GetContent();
Console.WriteLine("HTML content of the input document (first 200 chars): {0}", htmlContent.Substring(0, 200));
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully extracted HTML content from an editable document using GroupDocs.Editor for .NET. This powerful tool can handle various document formats, making it an excellent choice for document management tasks. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can integrate document editing capabilities into your .NET applications with ease.
