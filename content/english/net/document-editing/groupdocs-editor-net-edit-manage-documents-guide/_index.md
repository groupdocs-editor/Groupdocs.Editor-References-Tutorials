### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how to initialize GroupDocs.Editor in your application:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Editor;

string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual document path
Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath, new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```
## Implementation Guide
### Creating an EditableDocument Instance
**Overview**: Load and edit documents by creating an `EditableDocument` instance.

#### Loading a Document
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Editor.Options;

// Load your document with appropriate options
Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath, new WordProcessingLoadOptions());

// Create EditableDocument from the loaded file
EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.Edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions());
```
### Generating Embedded HTML from EditableDocument
**Overview**: Convert an entire document to a single embedded HTML string with stylesheets and resources.
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using GroupDocs.Editor.HtmlCss.Resources;

// Generate embedded HTML
string allAsHtmlInsideOneString = beforeEdit.GetEmbeddedHtml();
```
### Extracting Resources from EditableDocument
**Overview**: Retrieve images, fonts, CSS, and other resources from your document.
```csharp
List<IImageResource> allImages = beforeEdit.Images;
List<FontResourceBase> allFonts = beforeEdit.Fonts;
List<CssText> allStylesheets = beforeEdit.Css;
List<IHtmlResource> allResources = beforeEdit.AllResources;
```
### Obtaining HTML Content from EditableDocument
**Overview**: Extract pure HTML content without embedded resources.
```csharp
string htmlMarkup = beforeEdit.GetContent();
```
### Adjusting External Links in HTML Content
**Overview**: Modify external links for images, CSS, and fonts using custom prefixes.
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Define custom handlers for resource URLs
string customImagesRequesthandlerUri = "http://example.com/ImagesHandler/id=";
string customCssRequesthandlerUri = "http://example.com/CssHandler/id=";

// Adjust HTML content with prefixed links
string prefixedHtmlMarkup = beforeEdit.GetContent(customImagesRequesthandlerUri, customCssRequesthandlerUri);
```
### Saving EditableDocument as HTML File
**Overview**: Save the edited document back to disk in HTML format.
```csharp
using System.IO;

string htmlFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "document.html"); // Adjust the output path
beforeEdit.Save(htmlFilePath);
```
### Disposing and Event Handling for EditableDocument
**Overview**: Manage resource disposal and handle events related to document lifecycle.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("beforeEdit variable of EditableDocument type is {0} disposed", !beforeEdit.IsDisposed ? "not" : "already");

// Subscribe to the disposing event
EventHandler someMethod = delegate {
    Console.WriteLine("Disposing event was spotted!");
};
beforeEdit.Disposed += someMethod;
```
### Creating EditableDocument from HTML Content
**Overview**: Reconstruct an `EditableDocument` instance from existing HTML content.
```csharp
EditableDocument afterEditFromFile = EditableDocument.FromFile(htmlFilePath, null);
EditableDocument afterEditFromMarkup = EditableDocument.FromMarkup(htmlMarkup, allResources);

// Dispose resources once done
beforeEdit.Dispose();
afterEditFromFile.Dispose();
afterEditFromMarkup.Dispose();
editor.Dispose();
```
