## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through loading Word documents using GroupDocs.Editor. Each feature is broken down into logical steps with code snippets and explanations.

### Loading a Document
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to load a Word document for editing purposes using GroupDocs.Editor. By creating an `Editor` instance and configuring `WordProcessingLoadOptions`, you can easily manipulate the document content programmatically.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### 1. Import Required Classes
Begin by importing necessary classes:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;
```

##### 2. Specify Document Path
Define the path to your Word document within your directory structure:

```java
String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
```
Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` with the actual location of your documents.

##### 3. Create Load Options
Set up load options tailored for Word Processing documents:

```java
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
```

##### 4. Initialize Editor
Create an `Editor` instance using the document path and load options:

```java
Editor editor = new Editor(inputPath, loadOptions);
```

#### Explanation of Parameters and Methods
- **inputPath**: The full file path to your `.docx` file.
- **loadOptions**: Configures how the document is loaded (e.g., handling passwords).
- **Editor**: Central class for managing document loading and editing.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your `inputPath` is correct; otherwise, you'll encounter a `FileNotFoundException`.
- If dealing with password-protected documents, configure `loadOptions.setPassword("yourPassword");`.
