## Implementation Guide

Now that GroupDocs.Editor is set up in your environment, explore how to load documents using different methods and options.

### Load Document Without Options

This basic feature allows you to quickly access a document from a file path without additional configurations.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Quick loading for small or simple documents where no special handling is required.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for straightforward document access.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;

String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx"; // Replace with your document path
Editor editor1 = new Editor(inputPath);
editor1.dispose();
```

### Load Document With Word Processing Options

Enhance security and control by loading documents with specific options, such as setting a password.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Adds an extra layer of security for sensitive documents.
- **Use Case**: Useful when handling confidential files requiring authentication.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

String inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx"; // Replace with your document path
WordProcessingLoadOptions wordLoadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();
wordLoadOptions.setPassword("some password"); // Set the document password if needed

Editor editor2 = new Editor(inputPath, wordLoadOptions);
editor2.dispose();
```

### Load Document From InputStream Without Options

For scenarios where documents are not stored on disk, load them directly from an `InputStream`.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Facilitates handling of dynamic data sources.
- **Use Case**: Great for web applications processing uploaded files.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx"); // Replace with your file path

Editor editor3 = new Editor(inputStream);
editor3.dispose();
```

### Load Document From InputStream With Spreadsheet Options

Optimize memory usage when dealing with large spreadsheet files by using specific load options.

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Reduces the memory footprint for handling large documents.
- **Use Case**: Essential for efficiently processing big data files.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

InputStream inputStream2 = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx"); // Replace with your file path

SpreadsheetLoadOptions sheetLoadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
sheetLoadOptions.setOptimizeMemoryUsage(true); // Optimize memory usage for large documents

Editor editor4 = new Editor(inputStream2, sheetLoadOptions);
editor4.dispose();
```

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to load documents with GroupDocs.Editor can be leveraged in several real-world scenarios:

1. **Secure Document Sharing**: Use passwords for sensitive files shared within an organization.
2. **Web Application Integration**: Handle file uploads and downloads seamlessly in web apps.
3. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Optimize performance when processing large datasets.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Editor, consider these best practices:
