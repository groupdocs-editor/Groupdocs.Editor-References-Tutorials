## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Loading a Presentation

#### Overview
Loading a presentation, including password-protected files, is straightforward with GroupDocs.Editor. This feature allows you to open and prepare your document for editing.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define the Path to Your File**
Set up the path to your PPTX file:

```java
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample_pptx.pptx";
```

**2. Create an InputStream**
Initialize an `InputStream` from the file path:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

InputStream fs = new FileInputStream(inputFilePath);
```

**3. Set Up Load Options**
Configure load options, especially if your document is password-protected:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.PresentationLoadOptions;

PresentationLoadOptions loadOptions = new PresentationLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setPassword("some_password_to_open_a_document");
```

**4. Load the Presentation**
Use the `Editor` class to load your presentation with the specified options:

```java
Editor editor = new Editor(fs, loadOptions);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
- Double-check the password for protected files.

### Feature 2: Editing a Specific Slide in a Presentation

#### Overview
Edit specific slides within your presentation. This feature allows you to target individual slides and modify their content as needed.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Set Up Editing Options**
Define which slide to edit:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.PresentationEditOptions;

PresentationEditOptions editOptions = new PresentationEditOptions();
editOptions.setSlideNumber(0); // Edit the first slide (0-based index)
editOptions.setShowHiddenSlides(true);
```

**2. Obtain an Editable Document**
Fetch the editable content of the specified slide:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.EditableDocument;

EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.edit(editOptions);
```

**3. Extract HTML Content and Resources**
Retrieve the slide's content and associated resources:

```java
String originalContent = beforeEdit.getContent();
List<IHtmlResource> allResources = beforeEdit.getAllResources();
```

### Feature 3: Modifying Content of a Presentation Slide

#### Overview
Modify the content within your slides using straightforward text replacement or other editing techniques.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Replace Text**
Update specific text within the slide:

```java
String editedContent = beforeEdit.getContent().replace("New text", "edited text");
```

**2. Create a New Editable Document**
Generate a new document with the modified content:

```java
EditableDocument afterEdit = EditableDocument.fromMarkup(editedContent, allResources);
```

### Feature 4: Saving an Edited Presentation

#### Overview
Save your edited presentation securely, including setting a password for protection.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Initialize Save Options**
Configure save options with desired settings:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.PresentationSaveOptions;
import com.groupdocs.editor.formats.PresentationFormats;

PresentationSaveOptions saveOptions = new PresentationSaveOptions(PresentationFormats.Pptm);
saveOptions.setPassword("password");
```

**2. Prepare Output Stream**

```java
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

String outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/sample_out.pptm";
ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
```

**3. Save the Edited Document**
Use the `Editor` instance to save your changes:

```java
editor.save(afterEdit, outputStream, saveOptions);
```
