```

##### 3. Create Editor Instance and Load Document

Use the `Editor` class to load your document by providing its path:

```java
String documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
Editor editor = new Editor(documentPath, loadOptions);
System.out.println("Document loaded successfully!");
```
