### Basic Initialization and Setup

With GroupDocs.Editor added to your project, you're ready to start coding! Initialize the `Editor` class with the path to your Word document:

```java
Editor editor = new Editor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx", new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

This setup allows you to proceed with loading and editing documents.

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into distinct features, each focusing on a specific functionality of GroupDocs.Editor for Java.

### Load and Edit a Word Document

#### Overview
Loading and editing a document is your first step. This feature allows users to view and modify content directly within their application.

##### Step 1: Create an `Editor` Object
```java
// Initialize the Editor with the path to your Word file.
Editor editor = new Editor("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx", new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

##### Step 2: Edit Document
Use the `edit()` method to create an `EditableDocument` object, which you can modify as needed:
```java
EditableDocument document = editor.edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions());
```

### Extract Images from Document

#### Overview
Extracting images is crucial for users who need to manipulate or save visuals separately from text.

##### Step 1: Retrieve Images
```java
// Get the list of image resources in the document.
List<IImageResource> images = document.getImages();
```

### Save Images to Folder

#### Overview
Once extracted, you can save these images for further processing or archival purposes.

##### Step 2: Save Extracted Images
```java
String outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

for (IImageResource oneImage : images) {
    // Save each image with its original name and extension.
    oneImage.save(outputFolder + oneImage.getFilenameWithExtension());
}
```

### Extract Fonts from Document

#### Overview
Fonts are often used for branding or style purposes, making their extraction valuable in certain contexts.

##### Step 1: Retrieve Fonts
```java
// Obtain a list of font resources within the document.
List<FontResourceBase> fonts = document.getFonts();
```

### Save Fonts to Folder

#### Overview
After extracting, save these fonts for use in other applications or projects.

##### Step 2: Save Extracted Fonts
```java
for (FontResourceBase oneFont : fonts) {
    // Store each font resource with its original name and extension.
    oneFont.save(outputFolder + oneFont.getFilenameWithExtension());
}
```

### Extract Stylesheets from Document

#### Overview
Stylesheets define the look and feel of documents, making their extraction essential for comprehensive document editing.

##### Step 1: Retrieve Stylesheets
```java
// Access the list of CSS text resources in the document.
List<CssText> stylesheets = document.getCss();
```

### Save Stylesheets to Folder

#### Overview
Saving these stylesheets allows you to reuse or modify them independently from the original Word file.

##### Step 2: Save Extracted Stylesheets
```java
for (CssText oneStylesheet : stylesheets) {
    // Preserve each stylesheet with its original name and extension.
    oneStylesheet.save(outputFolder + oneStylesheet.getFilenameWithExtension());
}
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Digital Asset Management**: Extract images for a centralized digital asset repository.
2. **Branding Consistency**: Ensure brand fonts are used across all corporate documents.
3. **Custom Document Templates**: Use extracted stylesheets to create uniform document templates.

Integrating these features can streamline workflows and enhance productivity in any organization handling large volumes of Word documents.
