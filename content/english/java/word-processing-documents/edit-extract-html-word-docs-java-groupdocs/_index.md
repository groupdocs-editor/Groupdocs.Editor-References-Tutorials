class SetupGroupDocs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the editor instance here for further operations
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into two key features: loading and editing Word documents, followed by extracting HTML content.

### Loading and Editing Word Documents

This feature allows you to load a Word document and convert it into an editable format using GroupDocs.Editor.

#### Step 1: Open File Stream
Start by opening a file stream to your target Word document.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;

InputStream fs = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Document
Use `GroupDocs.Editor` with specific load options to open the document.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

Editor editor = new Editor(fs, new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

#### Step 3: Convert to Editable Format
Convert the loaded document into an editable format using `WordProcessingEditOptions`.

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.EditableDocument;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingEditOptions;

EditableDocument document = editor.edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions());
```

### Extract HTML Content from Document

This feature extracts and displays a portion of the document's content in HTML format.

#### Step 1: Open File Stream
As before, open a file stream to your target Word document.

```java
InputStream fs = new FileInputStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Document
Load the document using `GroupDocs.Editor` with specific load options.

```java
Editor editor = new Editor(fs, new WordProcessingLoadOptions());
```

#### Step 3: Extract HTML Content
Convert the loaded document to an editable format and extract its content as HTML.

```java
EditableDocument document = editor.edit(new WordProcessingEditOptions());
String htmlContent = document.getContent();
```

#### Step 4: Display HTML Content
For demonstration, display the first 200 characters of the extracted HTML content.

```java
System.out.println("HTML content of the input document (first 200 chars): " + 
    htmlContent.substring(0, Math.min(200, htmlContent.length())));
```

## Practical Applications

Understanding how to edit and extract content from Word documents opens up several practical applications:

1. **Document Management Systems**: Automate editing tasks within a centralized system.
2. **Web Content Creation**: Convert document content into HTML for web publishing.
3. **Data Extraction**: Retrieve specific data from documents for analysis or reporting.
4. **Integration with Other Systems**: Seamlessly integrate with CRM or ERP systems to manage documentation workflows.

## Performance Considerations

When working with GroupDocs.Editor, consider these performance tips:

- Optimize memory usage by closing streams and disposing of objects after use.
- For large documents, process content in chunks to avoid high resource consumption.
- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in document processing tasks.
