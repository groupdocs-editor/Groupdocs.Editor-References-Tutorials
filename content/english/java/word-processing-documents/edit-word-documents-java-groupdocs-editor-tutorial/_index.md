## Implementation Guide

### Load and Edit Word Document

#### Overview

This feature highlights how to use GroupDocs.Editor to open a Word document, modify its content via HTML, and prepare it for saving with enhanced control over editing processes.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

##### 1. **Set Up Your Environment**

Ensure your Java project is configured as outlined in the prerequisites section.

##### 2. **Initialize Editor Object**

To load a document, initialize an `Editor` object with the file path and loading options:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.Editor;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingLoadOptions;

String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
WordProcessingLoadOptions loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions();

Editor editor = new Editor(inputFilePath, loadOptions);
```

##### 3. **Create Editing Options**

Define the options for editing your document:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingEditOptions;

WordProcessingEditOptions editOptions = new WordProcessingEditOptions();
EditableDocument beforeEdit = editor.edit(editOptions);
```

##### 4. **Extract and Edit HTML Content**

Retrieve the embedded HTML to perform edits, such as replacing text or altering styles:

```java
String allEmbeddedInsideString = beforeEdit.getEmbeddedHtml();

// Example: Replace a subtitle
String allEmbeddedInsideStringEdited = allEmbeddedInsideString.replace("Subtitle", "New Subtitle");
```

##### 5. **Save the Edited Document**

After editing, save your changes back into a Word document:

```java
import com.groupdocs.editor.EditableDocument;
import com.groupdocs.editor.options.WordProcessingSaveOptions;

EditableDocument editedDoc = EditableDocument.fromMarkup(allEmbeddedInsideStringEdited, null);
WordProcessingSaveOptions saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions();

editor.save(editedDoc, "outputFilePath.docx", saveOptions);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Editor version matches your project’s requirements.
- Handle exceptions gracefully to diagnose issues with document loading or saving.
